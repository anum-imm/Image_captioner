# Image_captioner
This project is an Image Captioning system that automatically generates meaningful text descriptions for images. It combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract visual features and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly LSTM, to generate coherent and context-aware sentences.
